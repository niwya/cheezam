# Cheezam
## A cheese classifier

## Download the dataset
Find the preprocessed 5-cheeses dataset [here](https://cheezam.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Cheezam_dataset.zip).

### How to use
0. Clone this repo. 
1. Create a virtual environment using `venv`.
2. Set up the virtual environments by installing all required packages using `pip install -r filename`. If you only want to check out the neural network, use the `requirements.txt`. If you need to download and preprocess images on your own, you'll need `requirements_all.txt`.

Each code file is in `.ipynb` format. You can run them from Jupyter Notebook, on Google Colab or directly from Visual Studio Code, for instance.
